1. Created a new package in src/java/test called default package which has been submitted.

2. It has JUnit test file called as HW1 which has all the scenario test cases in it.

3. It also has Launcher1.java which helps me create a new board for testing only scenario.

4. The rest of the scenarios use default Launcher.java given in the package.

5. Every test case logic is described in comments in the code.
